# Movie library

The programming project of my first year at the Haute École en Hainaut was a _movie library_ in **C#**.  
It proposes a backup and search system as well as a GUI in French.

The project offers help: it's a html file with explications to facilitate the use of the library.

The program comes with two libraries:  
1. Great Movies  
2. Star Wars  

The user can remove the movies one-by-one or several in one time, it's also possible to remove libraries.  
Libraries and movies are easy to add and to peer.  
Each movie has it's own cover.  

Finally, it's easy to search a movie by it's title, director, gender, plot or date.
